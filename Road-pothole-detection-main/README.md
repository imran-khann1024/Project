# 🚧 Pothole Detection using YOLOv8

An AI-powered computer vision project that detects potholes from road images and videos using the YOLOv8 object detection model.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project automatically detects potholes from uploaded images and videos using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model.

The system is trained on a pothole dataset and predicts potholes by drawing bounding boxes around detected road damages.

This project can be useful for:

- 🛣️ Road Maintenance
- 🏙️ Smart Cities
- 🚗 Driver Assistance Systems
- 🤖 Autonomous Vehicles
- ⚠️ Road Safety Monitoring

---

## 📊 Dataset

The model was trained using a custom pothole dataset.

### Dataset contains

- Road Images
- Potholes
- Bounding Box Annotations

### Annotation Format

## 🧠 Model Training

The project uses the **YOLOv8 Nano** model.

### Training Configuration

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|--------|
| Model | YOLOv8n |
| Epochs | 50 |
| Image Size | 640 |
| Framework | Ultralytics |

### Training Code

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolo26n.pt")

model.train(
    data="data.yaml",
    epochs=50,
    imgsz=640
)
```

---

## 🖼️ Image Detection

```python
results = model(image)

annotated = results[0].plot()
```

The model detects potholes and draws bounding boxes with confidence scores.

---

## 🎥 Video Detection

The uploaded video is processed frame by frame.

Each frame is analyzed using the trained YOLOv8 model.

Detected potholes are marked with bounding boxes, and the processed frames are combined into a new output video.
